## Installation tutorial

### Windows

#### Method 1

1.Find the version folder you need and open it
2.Double-click XJZY.exe file

#### Method 2 (not recommended)

Open Command Prompt (cmd)
1.Use the cd Chick Manor Directory command to enter Chick Manor's directory
2.Use python XJZY.py run Chick Manor

###Other matters (be sure to read 1, 2!) 
1.Method 2 requires the installation of Python and the "colorama" module in Python, if you are just playing games, use method 1

2.The runtime automatically creates a XJZY.db (sqlite), which is a database file that stores data. Once deleted, it will be automatically rebuilt, and your save will be reopened...............

3.We currently only have a Windows version, and a Linux version may be developed in the future
